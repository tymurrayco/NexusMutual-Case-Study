# Nexus Mutual Case Study
 
##### Overview and Origin
 
 
Nexus Mutual Protocol
 
* **When was the company incorporated?**
> 2017 - Registered in the UK under registration number 11353187 as a discretionary mutual. A discretional mutual is not a provider of insurance, but a legal structure that enables members to trade with each other under the banner of one legal personality - not requiring conformity to insurance regulatory or legal requirements.
 
* **Who are the founders of the company?**
> Hugh Karp & Reinis Melbardis
 
* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
>Inefficiencies in the insurance industry have created large frictional overhead for customers. Up to 35% of insurance premiums are lost due to these frictional system costs. This has helped create a dynamic where the insurance industry model  is more and more adversarial towards the community it services. Blockchain technology can improve incentives through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, create more efficient transactions, and bring back a community-based approach. Core traditional insurance companies can be replaced by efficient blockchain technology. 
>
>This technology can remove administrative inefficiencies and a significant portion of governance and regulatory related costs by providing trust via transparent smart-contract code. A community-based approach can be brought back via the use of membership tokens where contributions benefit members and aligned incentives create a community spirit vs. an adversarial and unbalanced relationship between individuals and large institutions.
 
* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
>The peer-to-peer, Nexus Mutual, discretionary mutual is “funded” by an ERC-20 token (NXM). It is the key incentive mechanism that binds the mutual together. The token’s price varies based on the funding level of the Capital Pool as well as the minimum amount of capital necessary to support existing coverage.

>When funding is needed, the price will move lower to encourage token purchases. That value accrues to the Nexus Mutual smart-contract.  It may also move lower due to overall protocol business growth. This assures an equilibrium can be found between compensation for risk and membership expansion.

>For initial protocol development, Nexus Mutual raised funds from venture capital funds - Collider Ventures, 1confirmation, Blockchain Capital, Version One, Dialectic and 1kx.
 
>**Token creation comes from 5 categories:**
1. Initial tokens set aside for early contributors and founders upon contract deployment
2. Purchases via the Token Pricing Model outlined above
3. Tokens allocated for performers of claims assessments 
4. Tokens allocated to performers of risk assessments
5. Governance of the protocol. 
 
 
## Business Activities:
 
* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
 >Nexus Mutual offers coverage against potential bugs in smart contract code which can lead to smart contract failures and exploits. These failures and exploits can have significant financial repercussions for individuals and protocol treasuries.
 
* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
 > Nexus Mutual’s intended customers are defi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain. The market size for this set of customers is rapidly expanding and has very little historical context to reference. Nexus Mutual’s competitive advantage is it’s network effects and brand recognition. Community is at the core of Nexus Mutual’s success and this is ever-prevalent in the DeFi(Decentralised Finance) ecosystem. There is little standing in the way of a copy-cat, but a copy-cat would require high amounts of liquidity and trust for any sort of community to form and around and begin utilizing their protocol. The real question is - how would a copy-cat or identical protocol differentiate themselves?
 
* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**
>The protocol utilizes blockchain technology to address claims and perform claim assessments. This is done via either a trusted oracle that provides off-chain data, or a crowd-sourced information provider with voting mechanisms. In order to conduct claims assessments, the NXM token must be staked or put in custody of the protocol. Should the assessor be found to be acting dishonestly by the Advisory Board, those tokens will be “burned” or forfeited, thereby creating an incentive to act honestly. For Nexus Mutual’s current product, claims assessments can be done entirely remotely using publicly available data from block explorers where a “yes” or “no” exploit determination is simple to identify.
 
## Landscape:
 
* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**
>Nexus Mutual’s domain is insurance, with an initial focus on smart contract exploit coverage of Decentralized Finance protocols.
 
* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
>This domain, in the sense that it’s run on blockchain by computer code in smart-contract computer-logic driven fashion, is extremely new and Nexus Mutual is the first provider in the specific insurance niche of Smart Contract Coverage.
 
* **What are the other major companies in this domain?**
>Nexus Mutual’s primary competitors are not companies, moreso protocols given it operates on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain. Other DeFi Insurance protocols include DeFi Insurance Protocol, Etherisc, and Umbrella Protocol - although none are yet alternatives for smart contract coverage.
 
 
## Results
 
* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
>A traditional valuation of Nexus Mutual wouldn't be possible. Value accrues primarily to token holders whom are independent. Additionally, the token doesn’t respond to market price variation, but the Minimum Capital Requirement formula to balance coverage risks with capital requirements. That being said, according to open-orgs.info, which can pull trusted blockchain treasury information, the Nexus Mutual treasury currently stands at $20.5 million. According to Defi Pulse, Nexus Mutual has $350 million dollars worth of NXM token staked by token holders  in the protocol, for risk assessment, claims assessment and governance.
* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
>As with other DeFi protocols, traditional metrics don’t apply. Typically, treasury balance, total value locked and token price are good measurements of success. Token price is not-applicable to Nexus Mutual for reasons listed above.
 
* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
>Nexus Mutual is the unquestioned leader in this space with a unique niche. They will likely expand to other coverage areas in the future.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
>I would encourage Nexus Mutual to look into offerings outside of technology. This would include crop or drought insurance, flight-delay insurance, life insurance and hurricane or fire insurance. Utilizing measurable and reliable information sources for these events via Oracles and community mechanisms, trustless community-based coverage could be provided. 
 
* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
>It would expand the opportunity for NXM token holders to provide claims assessment coverage, and governance, which would add additional value to those NXM token holders. It would also be highly beneficial to those receiving the coverage. Reducing their expenses while increasing transactional efficiency. The community-driven network effects would be positive for all stakeholders.
 
* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
>These additional insurance products would utilize the same Nexus Mutual protocol and methodologies as outlined in the Nexus Mutual whitepaper. Blockchain technology via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, an ERC-20 token for proper community-based incentives, and an oracle to bring off-chain data to the contract/blockchain.
 
* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
>The technologies are already proven  and working, for Nexus Mutual, as well as the Ethereum ecosystem. It would just be a matter of establishing the criteria for claims assessment.
